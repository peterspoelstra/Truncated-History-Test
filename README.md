# Truncated-History-Test

This file contains the code for the paper: (Generalized) Truncated History for Synthetic Control Approaches. This paper will appear online soon.



This github contains the data and code. We have structured it in two main files:

* TH Code Table 1 Abadie et al (2010).R
* TH Code Table 1\_2\_3 SDID.R



These files contain the data for Table 1, 2 and 3 of the paper. 



An additional R file is included which applies the developed TH Robustness Check for other applications. This code file is not used in the paper.
